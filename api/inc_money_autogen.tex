\section{money/bitcoin}

This API endpoint contains various methods allowing to deal with Bitcoin.

\subsection{addpriv}

URL: \url{https://mtgox.com/api/2/money/bitcoin/addpriv}

Method to add a private key to a specific MtGox account.

Because we have no way to be 100\% sure that funds deposited on added
private keys are not taken to somewhere else at the same time, any
funds deposited on a private key added to a MtGox account will first
be redirected to a dynamically generated bitcoin address. This means
that even after adding a private key with bitcoins on it, those coins
will not be available after another 6 bitcoin confirmations.

This method support different formats of private key:

\begin{description}
\item[raw] A raw private key in base58 format
\item[sha256] A string used to generate a private key after being hashed
\item[auto] Auto-detect format based on how the private key looks like
\end{description}

\subsection{address}

URL: \url{https://mtgox.com/api/2/money/bitcoin/address}

Calling this method requires to be identified with an API key with the deposit right.

Generates a new (or not new) bitcoin address.

This will return a bitcoin address in variable \texttt{addr}.

By default, this method will return the current deposit bitcoin address.
If that address has not been used to make a deposit yet, no new address
will be generated. Once funds are received on this address, however, a
new address will be generated on next call.

By passing a description in the \texttt{description} parameter, one can
provide a description that will be included in the account history when
funds are received on this bitcoin address. In this case, a new address
is returned every time.

Additionally, when \texttt{description} is passed, \texttt{ipn} can also
be added to the call. In this case when bitcoins are received on the newly
generated address, the url specified in \texttt{ipn} is called with
details on the bitcoin transaction.

\subsection{null}

URL: \url{https://mtgox.com/api/2/money/bitcoin/null}

Generate a new bitcoin address not linked to any account

This method invokes the Bitcoin address generation system to create a new
bitcoin address. The newly generated address will however not be linked to
anything, and sending coins to it just mean throwing them away.

\subsection{wallet\_add}

URL: \url{https://mtgox.com/api/2/money/bitcoin/wallet\_add}

Calling this method requires to be identified with an API key with the deposit right.

Deposit a \emph{wallet.dat} file

This method takes one parameter: \texttt{wallet}, which should contain a
\emph{wallet.dat} file contents encoded in base64.

This method will scan the uploaded \emph{wallet.dat} file and extract any
private key found in it. It will actually not care if the file is in the
right format, and just search for bitcoin addresses based on the typical
binary prefix for said addresses.

If the private addresses are already linked to another MtGox account, no
action will be taken on these.
