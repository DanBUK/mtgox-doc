\section{Authentication}

Accessing the MtGox API is possible via different methods. The most common one
is HTTP, but it is also possible to push API calls through the WebSocket.

Accessing the API \emph{requires} creating an API key first. API keys can be
created on the MtGox website after logging in, and for each API key, a list
of rights is set by the user.

Each API key has a nonce value stored that ensures a request cannot be
replayed. It is up to the implementor to ensure that the passed nonce value is
ever increasing, for example by using the UNIX time as milliseconds. The nonce
value is handled as 64 bits on MtGox, which means it can go up to $2^{63}$.

\subsection{HTTP}

Pushing commands to the HTTP API involves signing the request by creating a
SHA512 HMAC hash of the sent message.
